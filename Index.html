        <h2>Exercise Benefits</h2>

        <p>
            Exercise is important to all forms of life because of the benefits it brings to the body and mind.
            Excercising helps you stay healthy, allowing your body to defend against disease and other health related problems
            like arthritis, high blood pressure, diabetes, etc. It also helps you lose weight and build muscle, giving you more
            energy to do things with you day. Excercising can also help you with mental problems like depression or anxiety with
            changes in neurochemical changes, releasing chemicals like dopamine. In this webpage, I want to discuss with you both
            the physical and the mental benefits you can recieve if you were to exercise.
